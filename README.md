## Project Overview

The **Wild-Oasis** project was originally built by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) as part of the _"React, Redux & More"_ course on Udemy. For my final project in the ALX Software Engineering program, I recreated and customized this project to serve as my portfolio website.

This project highlights various features and practices in modern web development, including state management using Redux, routing, component-based architecture, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Smooth Animations**: Eye-catching animations that enhance the user experience.
- **Dynamic Content**: Projects and experiences are rendered dynamically from the data.
- **User Authentication**: Optional login feature (can be added) for a personalized user experience.
- **Interactive UI**: Components are interactive and fluid, providing a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

The Wild-Oasis project uses a range of technologies to provide a modern and efficient web experience:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management to manage the application state across various components.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Modern JavaScript for logic and interactivity.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Sass (SCSS)**: Preprocessor for cleaner and more manageable CSS.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing.
- **Netlify**: For hosting the live demo of the website.
