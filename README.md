## Project Overview

The **Wild-Oasis** project was originally built by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) as part of the _"React, Redux & More"_ course on Udemy. For my final project in the ALX Software Engineering program, I recreated and customized this project to serve as my portfolio website.

This project highlights various features and practices in modern web development, including state management using Redux, routing, component-based architecture, and responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Smooth Animations**: Eye-catching animations that enhance the user experience.
- **Dynamic Content**: Projects and experiences are rendered dynamically from the data.
- **User Authentication**: Optional login feature (can be added) for a personalized user experience.
- **Interactive UI**: Components are interactive and fluid, providing a seamless user experience.
